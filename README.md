**Abstract**
The deep learning models have been widely accepted for recognizing human activities in recent
decades. These models have significantly beaten the classical machine learning techniques in terms of their
strong feature extraction capabilities. This is often an expensive and time-consuming process to retrain the
model while any changes are made in the HAR (Human Activity Recognition) community. In real life, the
activities recognition is a challenging issue because human beings are often performed activities not only
simple but also complex and heterogeneity type. We have deep learning models i.e. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long short-term memory (LSTM) for
recognizing the heterogeneity type activities. The activities recognition performance of the purposed model
was measured using a publically available KU-HAR dataset. We achieved an F1-score of 98.03%, 98.22%,
and 97.96% for CNNs, RNNs, and LSTM, respectively.
